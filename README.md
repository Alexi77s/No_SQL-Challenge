# No_SQL-Challenge
There are three separate part to this assignment. One is the Database set up with the Jypyter Notebook, second part is updating the database with new information for the restaurant, and third is exploratory analysis. UK food data was imported  through the Mongo database into the VS code and pretty print was used to interpret data structures.
